  - Observation Statement: Users would like a feature to have a type of barcode scanner that would return nutrition facts 
  - Supporting Data: "I liked quick entry via bar code scanner or an AI image recognizer (take a pic of my food and have the nutriants analyzed), the ability to enter via a repeat meal (e.g. I eat the same breakfast most morings, being able to just choose that is great). A reminder to enter food would help since I often forgot."
  - Team Action (if any): We plan to use the Open Food Facts API to return a nutrition score of a certain food, this way users can get a quick idea of the food or snack that they plan to eat, this additional feature does not need to have too much other implementation other than the food score and will be a useful feature.
